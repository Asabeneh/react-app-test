## React Application
## Folder Structure
After creation, your project should look like this:
```
/
  README.md
  index.html
  style.css
  js/
    browser.min.js
    react.dom.js
    react-dom.min.js
    react.js
    react-min.js
```
For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `index.html` is the page template and the React is inside this file(index.html);

In the project directory, you can run:
### `To start the application`
Double click on index.html.<br>
